Create a Notion web application fully functional with modern design using only HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This web application only need to work locally, so you don't setup any fancy back-end.
The Logo of this web application is just a white arrow in a black circle or you can make it with a simple letter N.
The header of this web application has login button but it don't have to be functional.
There are 3 types of status for each note. Which are "Open" in color grey, "In Progress" in color red and "Done" in the color green.
Each note has 3 properties name, description, and status.
You can change property of each note by clicking on it, the web application will show you detail of that note.
You can also change the status of each note.
You have to have a button to create new note.
Well I think the main content of the page should have some background color.
And I think you should arrange note according to their status, like "Done" goes to "Done" column, "Open" go to "Open" column.
Make it so you can dinamically edit each note showing in the web, don't use the default input prompt of the browser.
Give each note an option to change it's status, title, description and delete that note.
You have the option to change note's name, description too.
